# Virgo
Virgo interpreter. Currently it doesn't work. Damn.

Manifest.

- It must work.

- If it works don't touch it.

- If you want to add or change something, then find a reason of not to do it.

- If you REALLY want to add some feature, then implement it the simpliest, stupidest way possible.

- In most cases what you have done is not needed, what's really needed is not done.

- If your code doesn't throw segmentation faults then it's fine, even if it works like shit.

- Premature patterns don't work because you can't predict architecture.

- No conventions. Clusterfuck codebases are fine.

- Control is an attempt to limit variety. Don't even try to fight with variety, it's vital.

- No code of conduct. No sissies allowed.
